# Randomx - Rust

RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution (hence the name) together with several memory-hard techniques to minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware.

This is a rust build of the current Randomx algorithm

## Build steps

To build the project execute the following line in the terminal:

```sh
cargo build
```

## What was built
